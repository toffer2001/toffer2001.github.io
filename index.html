			<p>Time is our most valuable commodity. Therefore, I enjoy spending precious, unforgettable moments with my family every day.  Although in the evenings I've recently engaged in learning a new skill to code, family is my first focus; they are my pride, my joy, and my motivation to radiate as a a positive influence in this world.</p>
			<p>My wife, McKenzie, and I have been married for 7 years.  We have 2.5 kids.  Taiden is four years old, Declan is two, and in November we will celebrate our first baby girl!</p>
			<p>During the week, I dedicate much of my day with a medical device company called Larada Sciences.  Our flagship product is an FDA cleared medical device that is a solution to kill human head lice.  It is very rewarding to be part of a service that helps kids and families.  In almost my 5 years with the company, I have been privileged to help build our network of clinics to 175+ in the United States and 100+ clinics internationally.

			<p>Lastly, in addition to my late nights siting and coding on a computer, I enjoy staying physically active with my hobby (more like a passion) of ballroom dance.  I was fortunate to participate on the BYU Ballroom Dance Team, and today I teach private lessons for new and advanced dancers as well as instruct youth technique classes at Davis County Ballroom.</p>
